# Digitale Bildverarbeitung

## Abstract

This project was developed by a team of 3 students as part of the "Digitale-Bildverarbeitung" course at [DHBW Stuttgart](https://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de/). The goal was to implement a simple image & video processing application in Python. The application should be able to process frames to detect lanes and highlight them in the original image.
